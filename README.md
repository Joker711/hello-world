# hello-world
First repository on GitHub

Hello reader, I'm doing the 'Data Science Specialisation' course from Johns Hopkins Uni, via Coursera
This is my first time using GitHub.  It's part of the first unit in the Data Science course to set up a GitHub account
Now I'm doing the Hello-World tutorial to get started on how GitHub works.
